# Predicting monthly PET-CT referral rate using machine learning time-series forecasting
his project aimed to solve the problem of resource management in the provision of a PETCT scanning servic (staffing, patient appointment scheduling and scheduling planned maintenance etc).

The work investigated the Neural Prophet time series machine learning algorithm to predict the monthly rate of clinical referrals received in the Royal Free Nuclear Medicine Department for patients requiring a PETCT scan.

This work was presented at the British Nuclear Medicine Society (BNMS) Annual Meeting 2023
